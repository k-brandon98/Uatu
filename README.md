# Uatu
# AND101 Project 6 - CYOAPI Part 2: RecyclerView Edition

Submitted by: **Brandon Boit**

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Uatu** is an android app that **displays a scrollable list of characters from the Marvel API and allows the user to search for a specific character**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü•≥ üòì

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Implement a RecyclerView to display a list of entries from the API

The following STRETCH features are implemented:
